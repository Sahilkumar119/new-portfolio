---

## üöÄ Adding Projects (Super Simple!)

### Step 1: Open the file

Open `src/data/projects.js` in your code editor (VS Code, etc.)

### Step 2: Copy & Paste this template

**For Top Projects (your best work):**

```javascript
{
  id: 1,
  title: "Project Name Here",
  description: "Describe what your project does in 2-3 sentences. Be clear and engaging!",
  technologies: ["React", "Node.js", "MongoDB"],  // List all tech used
  link: "https://myproject.com",                   // Live demo URL
  github: "https://github.com/username/repo",      // GitHub repo
},
```

**For Step Projects (learning projects):**
Same template, just add it to the `stepProjects` array instead.

### Step 3: Fill in YOUR details

- Change the `id` to a unique number (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Add your project title
- Write a brief description
- List technologies you used
- Add your links (use `"#"` if you don't have a link yet)

### Example:

```javascript
export const topProjects = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "E-Commerce Website",
    description:
      "Built a full-featured online store with shopping cart, payment integration, and admin dashboard. Handles 100+ products with smooth performance.",
    technologies: ["React", "Node.js", "Stripe", "MongoDB"],
    link: "https://mystore.com",
    github: "https://github.com/myusername/store",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: "Weather App",
    description:
      "Real-time weather application with location detection and 7-day forecast. Clean UI with animated weather icons.",
    technologies: ["React", "OpenWeather API", "CSS3"],
    link: "https://myweather.netlify.app",
    github: "https://github.com/myusername/weather-app",
  },
];
```

### That's it! Save the file and your projects appear! ‚úÖ

## üì∞ Adding Blog Posts (2 Easy Steps!)

Blog posts require updating **2 files** (but it's super easy!)

### Step 1: Add Blog Preview (what people see on /blogs page)

Open `src/data/blogs.js` and add:

```javascript
{
  id: 1,
  title: "My First Blog Post",
  date: "October 19, 2025",                    // Publication date
  excerpt: "Short summary of your post...",    // 2-3 sentence preview
  slug: "my-first-blog-post",                  // URL-friendly (lowercase, hyphens only)
  tags: ["JavaScript", "Tutorial"],            // Topic tags
},
```

**Important:** The `slug` is what appears in the URL: `/blog/my-first-blog-post`

### Step 2: Add Full Blog Content

Open `src/data/blogPosts.js` and add:

```javascript
"my-first-blog-post": {  // ‚ö†Ô∏è MUST match the slug from Step 1
  id: 1,
  title: "My First Blog Post",
  date: "October 19, 2025",
  author: "Your Name",
  tags: ["JavaScript", "Tutorial"],
  readTime: "5 min read",
  content: `
Your blog content goes here. You can write normally.

## Use This for Main Headings

Just write paragraphs normally. **Make text bold** like this.
Use \`inline code\` for technical terms.

### This is a smaller heading

You can make lists:
- Point one
- Point two
- Point three

Or numbered lists:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

\`\`\`javascript
// Add code blocks like this
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
\`\`\`

> Add tips or important notes in quotes like this!

Write as much as you want. Just keep the format simple.
  `,
},
```

### Complete Blog Example:

**In blogs.js:**

```javascript
export const blogs = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Getting Started with React",
    date: "October 19, 2025",
    excerpt:
      "Learn the basics of React in this beginner-friendly tutorial. We'll build a simple app together and cover all the fundamentals.",
    slug: "getting-started-with-react",
    tags: ["React", "JavaScript", "Beginner"],
  },
];
```

**In blogPosts.js:**

```javascript
export const blogPosts = {
  "getting-started-with-react": {
    id: 1,
    title: "Getting Started with React",
    date: "October 19, 2025",
    author: "Sahil Kumar",
    tags: ["React", "JavaScript", "Beginner"],
    readTime: "8 min read",
    content: `
React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In this tutorial, we'll learn the basics.

## Why React?

React makes it easy to build interactive UIs. Here are the main benefits:
- Component-based architecture
- Fast and efficient
- Large community and ecosystem
- Easy to learn

## Your First Component

Here's a simple React component:

\`\`\`javascript
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
}
\`\`\`

This component displays a greeting. Simple, right?

## Next Steps

Now that you know the basics:
1. Practice building small components
2. Learn about props and state
3. Build a complete app

> Pro Tip: Start small and gradually build more complex projects!

  },
};

   - Put your best work in `topProjects`
   - Put learning projects in `stepProjects`

2. **Blogs:**

   - Write content in your editor first
   - Keep slugs simple (e.g., "react-tutorial")
   - Use headings to organize long posts
   - Add code examples for technical posts

3. **Both:**

## üÜò Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **DON'T:**

- Use the same `id` twice

- Write clear descriptions
- Save both files when adding blogs

## üì± Testing Your Content

After adding content:

1. **Save all files**
2. **Refresh your browser**
3. **Check:**

   - Blogs appear on `/blogs`
   - Blog posts open when clicked
   - All links work
